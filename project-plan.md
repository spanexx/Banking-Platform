# Bank App Backend Project Plan

## Overview
This project is to develop a secure, scalable banking application backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The backend will handle customer management, account management, transactions, and related financial operations. It will also include proper logging, error handling, and security measures.

## 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Customer registration, login, and profile management.
  - Account creation and management (e.g., checking, savings).
  - Transaction processing (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
  - Loan management (if applicable) and credit history.
  - Audit logging and reporting.
  - Support for administrative operations (e.g., user management, reporting).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Security (data encryption, input validation, secure API endpoints).
  - Performance (efficient queries, proper indexing in MongoDB).
  - Scalability and maintainability.
  - Compliance with regulatory standards.

## 2. Database Schema Design
Determine the entities and how they relate to each other. At a minimum, consider the following schemas:

### 2.1 Customer Schema
- **Purpose:** Store customer personal information and credentials.
- **Key Fields:** 
  - `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `passwordHash`
  - `address`, `phoneNumber`
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### 2.2 Account Schema
- **Purpose:** Represent bank accounts linked to customers.
- **Key Fields:**
  - `customerId` (reference to Customer)
  - `accountType` (e.g., checking, savings)
  - `accountNumber` (unique)
  - `balance`
  - `currency`
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### 2.3 Transaction Schema
- **Purpose:** Log financial transactions.
- **Key Fields:**
  - `accountId` (reference to Account)
  - `transactionType` (deposit, withdrawal, transfer)
  - `amount`
  - `timestamp`
  - `description`
  - `relatedAccountId` (for transfers, if applicable)

### 2.4 Audit/Log Schema (Optional)
- **Purpose:** Record system events for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Key Fields:**
  - `action`
  - `userId` (who performed the action)
  - `timestamp`
  - `details`

### 2.5 Additional Schemas (Based on Scope)
- **Loan Schema:** For managing customer loans.
- **Branch Schema:** If operating across multiple physical branches.
- **Card Schema:** For credit/debit card information linked to accounts.

*Note:* The exact number of schemas depends on your project scope. The above provides a starting point for a typical banking application.

## 3. Environment Setup
- **Monorepo Structure:**
  - Root folder contains shared `node_modules`, a root `package.json` with workspaces.
  - `apps/backend` for the Express/MongoDB backend.
- **Tooling:**
  - Node.js, Express, Mongoose.
  - Use dotenv for environment variables.
  - Use nodemon for development.

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. **Setup the Project Structure:**
   - Create the backend workspace (e.g., `apps/backend`).
   - Initialize a package.json for the backend.
2. **Implement Database Connection:**
   - Use Mongoose to connect to MongoDB.
   - Configure the connection string in a `.env` file.
3. **Develop the Schemas & Models:**
   - Create Mongoose models for Customer, Account, Transaction, and any additional schemas.
4. **Build API Endpoints:**
   - **Authentication:** Registration, login, and secure routes.
   - **Customer Management:** CRUD operations for customers.
   - **Account Management:** Create accounts, view balance, update account details.
   - **Transaction Processing:** Endpoints for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
   - **Audit Logging:** Log critical operations.
5. **Business Logic & Validations:**
   - Ensure transactions validate account balances.
   - Implement error handling and input validations.
6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
7. **Documentation:**
   - Document API endpoints and business logic.
   - Create an API documentation (e.g., using Swagger).
8. **Deployment & Monitoring:**
   - Set up production configurations.
   - Monitor performance, errors, and security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Security & Compliance
- **Implement Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Use JWT or session-based authentication.
- **Data Security:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data.
  - Use HTTPS in production.
- **Logging & Auditing:**
  - Maintain audit logs for sensitive transactions.
- **Compliance:**
  - Ensure the backend meets relevant financial regulations.

## 6. Roadmap & Milestones
- **MVP Release:**
  - Basic customer, account, and transaction functionalities.
- **Beta Release:**
  - Additional features (loans, audit logs, admin panel).
- **Final Release:**
  - Full feature set, rigorous testing, and security audits.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Implement microservices for scalability.
- Add real-time notifications (e.g., using WebSockets).
- Integrate third-party services for additional financial features.
